This folder contains a bunch of example code that works with the H++ programming language. In order to use the example code you must have built both the H++RT and Nestlewood(Your H++ compiler) or download the NestlewoodBundleC#.zip file which already has the generated .exe files for the H++RT and Nestlewood.

All of these examples utilise the "system" library. You must have the system.txt file in the same folder when attempting to execute any of the example code.
